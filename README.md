## üòï The Problem 
Health equity is the idea that everyone should have the same fair and just chance to achieve their best possible health, regardless of their circumstances. It‚Äôs achieved when health disparities are eliminated, and everyone has access to quality health care and wellness opportunities. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted individuals with social anxiety or those struggling to leave their homes, further exacerbating mental health issues and limiting access to fitness and wellness opportunities.

Many people are finding it challenging to reintegrate into public life due to lingering anxiety, isolation, and a loss of social skills. This marginalized group faces significant barriers‚Äînot just in terms of physical fitness, but also in mental health, social engagement, and professional opportunities. Post-COVID, these individuals are not only more vulnerable to job market disadvantages but also experience compounded health risks due to reduced physical activity and prolonged isolation.

This project aims to bridge the gap by creating a wellness website specifically designed for individuals struggling with social anxiety and those hesitant to leave their homes post-COVID. By focusing on mental health and social skill development, PaceMates will provide accessible resources to help users gradually overcome anxiety while staying physically active. Through guided running events, mental health support, and opportunities for community building in a safe and controlled way, the website fosters an inclusive environment for those left behind in traditional fitness models.

By addressing this issue, we can provide an affordable alternative that encourages individuals to stay active and build a supportive community around running. This initiative specifically targets the needs of a marginalized group, helping them regain control of their mental and physical well-being. In doing so, we aim to offer a holistic solution that promotes mental health, reduces health disparities, and strengthens social skills for those impacted by the COVID-19 lockdowns.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental and physical health of New Yorkers, particularly among those dealing with social anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. The rising costs of gym memberships have made indoor fitness options unaffordable for many, leaving individuals without access to supportive environments that promote both physical activity and mental well-being. As a result, there is a need for community-based alternatives that cater specifically to these individuals, such as running.

**The Need for Community After COVID-19**

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted social connections, significantly heightening the need for community-driven activities to support physical and mental well-being. Feelings of isolation and anxiety have intensified, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to engage in physical activity. The lack of social connections can exacerbate mental health issues, leading to a cycle of inactivity that adversely affects overall well-being. Studies have shown that participation in group fitness or community events can significantly reduce feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. Therefore, community-driven activities that emphasize social engagement are crucial in mitigating these feelings and fostering meaningful connections.

**Breaking Down Cost Barriers**

Cost remains a significant barrier to fitness, particularly for individuals with limited financial resources. Research from the National Library of Medicine indicates that individuals with low socioeconomic status perceive more barriers to physical activity compared to those with higher status, with financial constraints being a key factor. New York City has some of the highest gym membership costs in the country, averaging over $106 per month‚Äî$61.68 higher than the national average.  Post-pandemic, gym membership prices have notably increased, rising from $112 in January 2019 to $128 by August 2022, marking a 14.33% increase. Initially, during the pandemic, prices dropped to nearly $100 per month, but they rebounded to pre-pandemic levels of around $112 by mid-2021 and have continued to rise since then. 

These rising costs make regular exercise unaffordable for many, creating barriers for residents seeking access to fitness facilities and hindering efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle in a city already facing a high cost of living. In contrast, running offers a free and flexible alternative, helping individuals overcome financial constraints while providing an accessible way to stay active and connected with others.

**Rising Obesity Rates in the Aftermath of COVID-19**

Obesity rates in the U.S. have been escalating, with the CDC reporting that over 20% of American adults are classified as obese‚Äîa condition exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to reduced activity levels and increased stress-related eating. In New York, the situation is even more pronounced, with obesity rates ranging from 25% to 30%. Approximately two out of every three adult New Yorkers fall into either the obese (29.1%) or overweight (34.5%) Body Mass Index (BMI) categories, affecting over 8.4 million adults statewide. Research indicates that sedentary lifestyles, poor eating habits, and heightened levels of stress, depression, and anxiety were intensified during the pandemic, contributing to significant weight gain and health-related issues, including heart disease and diabetes.

**The Rise of Running: A Solution for Mental Health and Community Building**

Running has emerged as a leading fitness trend during and after the pandemic, offering an accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional gym memberships. Many individuals have turned to running not only for physical health but also for mental clarity and emotional relief. Studies show that group fitness activities can significantly reduce feelings of isolation and depression, making community running events an ideal solution for those seeking support.

However, new runners, especially those who developed social anxieties during the pandemic, may hesitate to participate in organized activities. Our running events aim to create a welcoming environment that encourages in-person participation, helping individuals overcome their apprehensions. By fostering a sense of belonging, these events provide opportunities for social interaction and community building, enhancing both the enjoyment of running and commitment to maintaining physical health.

Fitness Trends 2021 revealed that outdoor activities like running ranked as the top trend in 2020 and 2021, indicating a notable surge during the pandemic. New-pandemic runners are 19.82% less likely to participate in in-person races over the next 12 months and show a 115.37% preference for virtual races compared to pre-pandemic runners. Motivations for running have also shifted, with physical health being the primary focus for 72% of new runners, an increase of 18.03% from before the pandemic.

Community running events can greatly benefit these new-pandemic runners by providing a supportive environment that encourages participation. These events not only help individuals overcome hesitations but also enhance the enjoyment of running and promote a commitment to physical health. Running offers a free, flexible alternative to costly gym memberships while promoting outdoor exercise, which research shows is beneficial for both mental and physical well-being.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Product Overview
PaceMates will act as a holistic platform focused on promoting running as an accessible, community-oriented fitness option. By targeting the growing concerns of social isolation, anxiety, and depression in New York City, this initiative aims to create a supportive environment that encourages physical activity while enhancing mental well-being and fostering social connections.

The website will feature a centralized event discovery system with a user-friendly interface, allowing individuals to easily find local running events tailored to their specific preferences. By offering filters such as pace, demographics, distance from the event, and location, users can identify events that align with their personal fitness goals and interests. This functionality will empower users to connect with others who share similar objectives, fostering a sense of belonging and community within their local areas.

In addition to discovering events, the platform will allow users to generate and promote their own running events, creating a dynamic space for community engagement. By organizing group runs, themed events, or even charity races, individuals can take an active role in building their fitness networks. This user-generated feature encourages more social interactions and increases participation in physical activities, helping cultivate a supportive environment where members motivate each other to stay active and healthy.

## ü§∏ Key Technical Challenges
**Integration with Google Maps**

One of the key challenges we anticipate is the integration of Google Maps to display real-time location data on our home page, highlighting the starting points of all running events. This will involve utilizing the Google Maps API to dynamically fetch and display event locations while ensuring smooth performance as users interact with the map. Additionally, each event page will feature a map that shows both the start and end points of the run. Managing API calls, handling multiple location datasets, and optimizing the user experience for seamless interaction will be crucial to the success of this feature.

**Customizable Event Filters**

Another significant challenge involves enabling users to filter events based on various criteria such as location, date, time, and descriptive tags in real-time. The complexity arises from the multiple approaches available for filtering, searching, and sorting the information, as each method can impact performance differently. Developing an efficient search and filter system will require querying the database and dynamically updating results to enhance user experience.

By fostering a sense of belonging and accountability, users will be more likely to participate in events and maintain their fitness routines.

**Language Inclusivity and Accessibility**

Prioritizing accessibility, the website will provide resources in multiple languages and offer free events. This commitment will make it easier for individuals from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses to engage in running and reap the associated health and social benefits.

**Push Notifications for Event Reminders**

To enhance user engagement, the website will implement push notifications that allow users to receive timely reminders about upcoming events via text, email, or calendar invites. These notifications will ensure that participants never miss important updates, thereby improving attendance rates and fostering a sense of community. Additionally, timely reminders will help users better prepare for events, leading to a more organized and enjoyable experience.

**Integration with Local Organizations**

The website will collaborate with local community organizations, schools, and health services to promote events and provide additional resources. By hosting workshops, clinics, and incentive programs, the platform will help users gain valuable knowledge about fitness and nutrition while encouraging participation in running activities.

**Gamification and Integration with Fitness Tracking Apps** 

The website will introduce a gamification feature that tracks users' participation streaks, allowing them to see how many consecutive days they have attended a run or set weekly goals to monitor their achievements. This feature can motivate users to stay active and engaged with running events. By visualizing their progress, users may feel more compelled to maintain their streak or reach their set goals, fostering a sense of accomplishment and encouraging regular participation. Additionally, it can create friendly competition among users, enhancing community engagement.

**Analytics Dashboard for Event Organizers**

To support event organizers, the website will include an analytics dashboard that enables them to view crucial statistics such as registration numbers and attendee demographics. By providing organizers with insights into participant behavior and event performance, this feature will help them make informed decisions about future events, marketing strategies, and community engagement efforts. Understanding attendee demographics will also aid in tailoring events to better meet the needs of diverse groups.
